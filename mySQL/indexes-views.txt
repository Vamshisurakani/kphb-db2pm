indexes are used to speed up data retrival operations on database tables. it works like books index allowing database to find rows quickly without scanning entire table or going row after row
 by default index will be created for primary key

 create index index-name on tablename(columnname)

 delete the index:
 drop index index-name

 indexes speed up where,order by,group by etc.., commands
 but over indexing slows down insert,delete,update.

 views:
   views are used as a virtual table based on the result of
   a SQL Query. it does not store data physically but provides a way to simplify complex queries 
   syntax: 
   create view viewname as query;
   it acts like abstract layer over tables.
   it provides security to the tables. views cannot have indexes

stored procedure: A stored procedure  is a precoompiled collection of SQL statements stored in the database. it can accept inputs as parameters and perform operations

it is used to improve performance and cache results in database
it's main use is code reusability

syntax: 
delimiter //
create procedure procedure_name(parameters)
begin
  query
end
//

call procedure_name(arguments)

eg:delimiter //
create procedure 
countryWise(c varchar(20))
begin
SELECT * FROM office.employees
where country=c;
end
// 

call countryWise("uk")
