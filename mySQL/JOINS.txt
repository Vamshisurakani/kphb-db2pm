JOINS:
   Joins are used to combine two or more number of tables and retrieve the data based on common field connection
  There are different joins existed in mySQL
 i. innerJoin: inner Join is used to retrieve the 
    data which is common on both the tables
    syntax:
        select t1.field1,t2.field2....
        from table1 as t1
        inner join
        table2 as t2 ON
        t1.common-field=t2.common-field
 ii. left Join: left join is used to retreive the data which 
   is available in left table and common data
   syntax:
        select t1.field1,t2.field2....
        from table1 as t1
        left join
        table2 as t2 ON
        t1.common-field=t2.common-field
 iii. right Join : right join is used retrive the data available in right table and common data
      syntax:
       select t1.field1,t2.field2....
        from table1 as t1
        right join
        table2 as t2 ON
        t1.common-field=t2.common-field
iv. full outer join: In mySQL, full outer join is not possible but can be achieved by 'union'
      left join query
      union
      right join query
