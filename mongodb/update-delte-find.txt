mongoDB is a open source NoSQL,document based schema less,BSON database which is used to storage , manage,scale large more efficiently
eg: 
{
name:"raj",
age:50
}

update: mongoDB provides a way to update in two ways
   i.updateOne: it is used to update the document based on a condition. this method can update only one value
db.collection-name.updateOne(conditionObject, updation object)
eg:db.students.updateOne({name:"prasad},{$set:{marks:0}})
but in case multiple elements need to updated. we can use
updateMany.
   ii.updateMany: it is used to update multiple documentsat a time.
    db.collection-name.updateMany(conditionObject, updation object)
eg:db.students.updateMany({name:"prasad},{$set:{marks:0}})

Delete: delete command is used to delete a specific conditioned document/documents. we have two ways to do that
     i. deleteOne: it is used to delete only one document which matched specific criteria 
      db.collection-name.deleteOne(conditionObject)
     ii.deleteMany:it is used to delete all the documents which matched specific criteria
      db.collection-name.deleteMany(conditionObject)

iv. find: find is used to read/display the documents that matched specific criteria, we can do it in two ways
     i.findOne: it is used to read only one document that matched given criteria
        db.collection-name.findOne(filteredObject)
     ii.find:it is used to read all the documents that matched given criteria
       db.collection-name.find(filteredObject)
